<h3> Short Bio </h3>
 <p> <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> am a graphic design major; I enjoy graphic art as much as making them. My favorite designs are ones that involve text and letters. People often donâ€™t pay enough attention to text, which is a shame because you can do so much with text. My strongest skill would be my work efficiency.  </p>

<h4> Works Done </h4>

 <p> <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have worked in flash, after effects, Photoshop, illustrator, and InDesign.  The flash animations on the home page were made using key frames and blank key frames with motion tween. I am fairly experienced with flash animation. I have drawn and design my own fictional character in illustrator which I then animated in flash. I have also design logos and graphic arts in illustrator. Using InDesign I have design numerous magazines spreads as well as articles making use of a grid and color theory. In after effects I have created a short video using text and preset effects. Lastly I am able to make simple photo correction with Photoshop.  </p>
